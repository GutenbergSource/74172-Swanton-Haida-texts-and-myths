<p>Some letters are followed by a period or exclamation mark. The + sign is used as a length mark.

</p><p>Some of the text is presented in an intralineair fashion. In that case, please just transcribe the text
during the P-rounds, and format the text as follows during the F-rounds. Line breaks in the English can be 
removed, but each phrase should be on its own line. Give one empty line for a new line, and two empty lines for
a new paragraph.
